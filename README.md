# Where In The World Is Carmen Sandiego?

## Introduction

### Use SQL to find Carmen Sandiego

Weâ€™re going to use what weâ€™ve learned already about querying a database using SQL commands to to chase down and capture an elusive and world-renowned thief, Carmen Sandiego!

This is an excellent lab to collaborate with classmates on!

## Setup

This lab requires *.sql files used to create a database with tables that contain data about locations across the ðŸŒŽâ€¦

1. Move into your ~/code folder:
2. Clone the repo to obtain the files:
 git clone https://git.generalassemb.ly/sei-blended-learning/sql-lab.git
3. Move into the newly created sql-lab folder:
4. Open VS Code:
5. Open a terminal session (control + backtick) and run ls - you should see three files: clues.sql, world.sql & solution.md.
6. Start the psql interactive terminal:
7. Create a database named carmen and connect to it:
 CREATE DATABASE carmen;
 \c carmen
8. Run the following command to run world.sql that creates city, country & countrylanguage tables and seeds their data using the:

## Exercises

The goal is to figure out what city Carmen Sandiego is heading to so that she can be met by the proper authorities.

Youâ€™ll be writing SQL queries within clues.sql to answer each clue.

Check your progress by running the queries that you write in clues.sql using: \i clues.sql

## Hints

- Use the psql \d & \d tablename commands to list & display the schema of each of the three tables.

- Google and collaborate to reach the goal of finding out where Carmenâ€™s destination is.

- For example, youâ€™ll certainly need to know about the ORDER BY clause.

- Try not to peek too much at solution.sql.
